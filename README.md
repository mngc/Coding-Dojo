## About this Dojo

There are many great websites which contains a lot of problems that can be solved in a codo dojo, however, I didn't find one that really suit my ideas so I created this one. 
I wanted to create a template for coding katas that are easy to use and thatÂ´ll take you no time to set it up to your needs or ideas. 

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. 
* A project that solves a problem, helps others.
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a projects with unit tests from scratch.
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
* Coding is fun :smile:

I'll be adding more katas in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
